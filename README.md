# AgentPages
This web app will attempt to solve the problem of creating landing pages for homes on sale. With tools like Zillow and Redfin under scrutiny for their business practices, there is an opportunity to capitalize on the market they are leaving up for grabs. In essence, the web app will be a website builder such as wix, wordpress, or webflow, but with one key differentiation. The common website builder is much easier to use than coding a website from scratch, but they still have some sort of learning curve. AgentPages makes this easier by taking the work away from the user (a real estate agent who has no wish to learn the ever changing landscape of UX/UI), and offloading it to AI. Since AI is such a hot keyword lately, I’ll just describe part of the user journey. Ok so imagine Isaac, a real estate agent who’s listed a property for sale. One of the things he wants to put on the open house flyer is a QR code leading to a landing page specifically for that home. He searches for options but can’t find a tool that wouldn’t charge him an arm and a leg or force him to learn a new software. Luckily he found AgentPages where all he had to do was upload some pictures of the home he’s selling, put in some information about the home, press a button, and that’s it. With a press of a button he got a link and a QR code to a professional landing page complete with audience-focused website copy, lead capture systems, and SEO optimizations. Isaac is now a happy man.
